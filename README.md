New Changes: I'm using a new function called eval() to evaluate a string. the string must be in a certain format, so i split this.field into two variables, this.display (to the user) and this.backend (what we feed into eval()). All buttons should work, except parentheses and undo. May still be errors when doing complex functions, but most simple functions work. Also created branches.
